    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pepperoni pizza recipe produces a quick and easy classic! Delicious homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce have never been easier.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup no-sugar-added pizza sauce (such as Rao's)</li>
        <li>2 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix yeast into warm water in a small cup until dissolved; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese into a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 90 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds, until completely melted. Stir in yeast mixture and egg until combined; it will not fully incorporate at this point.</li>
        <li>Stir in almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt. If difficult to mix, reheat in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds to soften the cheese. Stir again until well incorporated. Knead dough by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough onto the prepared baking sheet and press with your fingers into a thin crust about 11 or 12 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Spread pizza sauce over crust. Top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, then scatter pepperoni over top.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Cut into six slices.</li>
    </ol>
