    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Created by The Wonka Chocolate Factory® in 1964, this drink was never released for public consumption because Willy Wonka himself deemed it “too powerful”. The recipe was leaked to the public after an act of corporate espionage during a promotional tour of the factory. I can’t replicate the exact formula here for obvious reasons, but here’s slightly altered (safer) version. Same great taste of course!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>redacted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sorry everyone. Wonka Inc. made me take their formula down.</li>
    </ol>
