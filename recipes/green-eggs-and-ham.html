    <h2 class="greeneggstext">Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">This dish was created in the ‘60s by the late great Dr. Geisel. It wasn’t well received at first because                 of its very pushy marketing and maybe its less than appetizing presentation I must admit, but once critics gave it a chance it quickly grew on them. It’s a great meal for those on the go, whether you’re on a train or a boat or even a goat. So what are you waiting for? Give it a go! TRY THEM! TRY THEM! YOU WILL SEE!!</p>
